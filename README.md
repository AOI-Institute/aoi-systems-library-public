# AOI Systems Library

Reference implementations of common SaaS building blocks (authentication, billing, webhooks, RBAC,
rate limiting, ...), each written to a shared contract in **eight languages**: C#, Go, Java,
JavaScript, PHP, Python, Rust and TypeScript.

The code was machine-generated and is **unfinished**: many suites do not pass
yet. This repository is where that gets fixed in the open. Treat everything here as a starting point,
not production code.

## Layout

    saas_templates/<lang>/<system>_<lang>.<ext>          implementation
    saas_templates/<lang>/<system>_<lang>_tests.<ext>    its tests
    docs/                                                reference spec for the auth / admin / trial-abuse systems
    tools/run_suites.py                                  one test runner for every language
    ci/baseline.json                                     suites known to fail today

18 systems x 8 languages = 144 suites. (Java has no `data_export_compliance` tests yet.)

## Status

Last checked 2026-10-01 with `tools/run_suites.py` on Linux. Legend: ✅ passes, ❌ fails, ➖ tests missing. The C# column comes from the first CI run on a
GitHub runner (the other seven languages were run locally and then confirmed by CI).

CI's per-suite table (in each job's summary) is the live version of this; this table is refreshed by
hand and can lag. Some failures depend on the toolchain version: the Python suites were written
against Python 3.14, where annotations are evaluated lazily, and fail with a `NameError` on 3.11/3.12.

## Running tests

    python tools/run_suites.py --lang go                       # every system in one language
    python tools/run_suites.py --lang rust --systems webhooks  # one suite

The runner installs each language's packages into `.deps/` on first use. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the toolchain you need per language.

## How to help

Every ❌ above is a good first issue:

1. Pick one system in one language, run its suite, read the failure.
2. Fix the implementation (or the test, if the test is wrong; say why in the PR). Never weaken a test
   just to get green.
3. Open one pull request per system and language, with `git commit -s` sign-off.
4. If the suite now passes, delete its line from `ci/baseline.json`.

CI fails only on **regressions** (a suite that is not in `ci/baseline.json` and does not pass), so
`main` stays green while the known failures are worked down. New systems and new languages are welcome:
open a "New system or feature" issue first so the contract is agreed across languages.
